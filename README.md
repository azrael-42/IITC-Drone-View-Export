# IITC-Drone-View-Export

This plug-in is not expected to be useful to most people - but if you are interested in sharing information about what a Drone Mark I can "see" from a given portal, please use it and let me know.

It relies on my IITC-Drone_Helper plug-in, so unless you have that installed, do not be surprised if this fails to do anything.

Hit "v" on your keyboard, or the "V" icon on the tool bar on the map to start it off. You will get a display of cells that contain portals you may be able to see while your drone is on the selected portal. Please do not use any techniques that allow you to jump further when you have a portal key.

It is deliberately set up to use a slightly large area when calculating what can be seen, so do not be surprised if there is a patch or 2 with portals you cannot actually see. This is to help with error checking if the portal network is updated. If you can't see identified portals, just click/tap inside the rectangle to toggle it to off. In the unlikely event that you can see a portal not predicted (or you have toggled off a cell by mistake), just click/tap the in the area of the cell and it will become part of the view.

If the cell does not contain any portals, you are unable to change its visibility to off, don't worry about it if you accidentally selected it.

Thanks for looking.
